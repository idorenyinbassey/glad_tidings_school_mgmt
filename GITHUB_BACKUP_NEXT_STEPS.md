# Push to GitHub (replace with your repository URL)
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify GitHub Backup
1. Visit your GitHub repository
2. Confirm all files are uploaded including:
   - Updated README.md with completion status
   - Complete documentation in docs/ folder
   - All result management code in results/ app
   - Final completion report
   - Updated dashboard templates

### Step 3: Production Deployment (Optional)
If deploying to production server:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   export DEBUG=False
   export SECRET_KEY="your-production-secret-key"
   export DATABASE_URL="your-production-database-url"
   ```

2. **Database Setup**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py collectstatic
   python manage.py populate_classes_subjects
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

3. **Web Server Configuration**:
   - Configure Nginx/Apache for static files
   - Set up Gunicorn for application server
   - Configure SSL certificates for HTTPS
