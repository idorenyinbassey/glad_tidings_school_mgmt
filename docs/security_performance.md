# Security and Performance Improvements

This document outlines the security and performance improvements implemented in the Glad Tidings School Management System.

## Security Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Security Settings

- **SSL/HTTPS Settings**
  - `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`: Forces all non-HTTPS requests to HTTPS
  - `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`: Ensures session cookies are only sent over HTTPS
  - `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`: Ensures CSRF cookies are only sent over HTTPS
  - `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`: Enables HTTP Strict Transport Security with a 1 year duration
  - `SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`: Applies HSTS to all subdomains
  - `SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD`: Allows preloading of HSTS settings in browsers

- **Content Security Policy**
  - Implemented strict CSP headers to protect against XSS attacks
  - Limited script sources to same-origin
  - Limited form submissions to same-origin
  - Configured separate policies for development and production environments

- **Cross-Site Scripting Protection**
  - `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER`: Enables browser XSS filtering
  - `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF`: Prevents MIME type sniffing

- **Clickjacking Protection**
  - `X_FRAME_OPTIONS`: Set to 'DENY' to prevent the site from being framed

### 2. Secret Management

- Implemented `django-environ` to manage sensitive settings
- Moved secret keys and credentials to environment variables
- Created a separate .env file for development settings
- Generated a strong, random SECRET_KEY

### 3. Debug Settings

- Ensured DEBUG is set to False in production
- Added environment variable control for toggling debug mode

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Database Optimization

- **Added strategic indexes** on frequently queried fields:
  - Added indexes to TuitionFee model: session, term, due_date, status
  - Added indexes to Payment model: payment_date, method, receipt_number, reference
  - Added indexes to Expense model: date, category
  
- **Added composite indexes** for common query patterns:
  - TuitionFee: (student, session, term), (status, due_date)
  - Payment: (payment_date, method), (created_at, created_by)
  - Expense: (date, category)

- **Connection Pooling**:
  - Set `CONN_MAX_AGE` to keep database connections alive
  - Different settings for development vs production

### 2. Caching System

- **Django Redis Integration**:
  - Implemented Django Redis for caching in production
  - Used local memory cache for development

- **Template Caching**:
  - Enabled Django's cached template loader in production
  - Added cache middleware with 15-minute timeout

- **Session Caching**:
  - Stored sessions in the cache for faster access

### 3. Template Rendering

- Added template fragment caching
- Implemented cached template loader for production

## Environment Management

- Created separate configurations for development and production
- Used environment variables for configuration
- Documented required environment variables in the .env file

## Testing

- Created a comprehensive test script for security and performance verification
- Added database query analysis
- Added template rendering performance tests

## Usage Instructions

### Running in Development

1. Use the provided `.env` file with development settings
2. Run with DEBUG=True for developer-friendly error messages
3. Cache backends will auto-switch to development mode

### Deploying to Production

1. Set proper environment variables:
   ```
   DEBUG=False
   SECRET_KEY=<strong-random-key>
   SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True
   SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True
   CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True
   ```

2. Configure a proper cache backend:
   ```
   REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-server:6379/1
   ```

3. Run the security test script:
   ```
   python scripts/test_security_performance.py
   ```

4. Apply database migrations for the new indexes:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate accounting
   ```
