# User Model and Manager Updates

This document describes fixes applied to the custom user model and manager.

## Issue: `createsuperuser` defaulting to 'student' role

**Problem:** When creating a superuser with `python manage.py createsuperuser`, the user was assigned the 'student' role instead of 'admin'.

**Solution:** Implemented a custom `CustomUserManager` class that ensures superusers are assigned the 'admin' role by overriding the `create_superuser` method.

## Issue: Admin panel user creation fails with 'make_random_password' error

**Problem:** When creating users through the Django admin panel, an error occurred: `'CustomUserManager' object has no attribute 'make_random_password'`.

**Solution:** Added the `make_random_password` method to the `CustomUserManager` class to generate random passwords, replicating the functionality from Django's `BaseUserManager`.

## Testing

Created tests to verify:
1. Superusers are correctly assigned the 'admin' role
2. The `make_random_password` method works correctly

## Additional Considerations

- Created a data migration to fix existing superusers that might have been incorrectly assigned the 'student' role.
- This implementation maintains backward compatibility with the existing codebase while fixing the role assignment issues.
