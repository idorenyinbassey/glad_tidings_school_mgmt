## Development Guidelines

### Running Tests

To run all accounting tests:
```bash
python manage.py test accounting
```

To run specific test files:
```bash
python manage.py test accounting.tests.test_models
python manage.py test accounting.tests.test_views
```

### Adding Template Filters

1. Add new filters to `accounting/templatetags/accounting_filters.py`
2. Register with `@register.filter(name='filter_name')`
3. Add tests in `accounting/tests/test_templatetags.py`
4. Clear the template cache after changes:
   ```bash
   python manage.py clear_template_cache
   ```

### Common Issues

If template filters aren't recognized:
1. Ensure templates are loading the filters with `{% load accounting_filters %}`
2. Verify the templatetags directory has `__init__.py`
3. Clear the template cache
4. Restart the development server
